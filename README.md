#** esp32node-ros **

## **Overview**

`esp32node-ros` is a repository that provides a framework for integrating the ESP32 microcontroller with the Robot Operating System (ROS). This combination allows you to leverage the capabilities of the ESP32 in robotic applications, enabling communication with other ROS nodes and taking advantage of the extensive ROS ecosystem.

## **Features**

- **ESP32 Integration:** Easily interface your ESP32 with ROS for robotics applications.
- **Communication:** Establish communication channels between the ESP32 and other ROS nodes.
- **Example Nodes:** Sample ROS nodes for common tasks, demonstrating the integration.

## **Prerequisites**

Before using this repository, make sure you have the following:

- [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) installed.
- [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/Installation) installed on your development machine.

## **Getting Started**

1. Clone the repository:
